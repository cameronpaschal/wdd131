            <p>9 I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring
                some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.</p>

            <h2>Alma 34:35</h2>
            <p>For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no
                place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</p>
